# Ghidra Code Browser Configurations
Ghidra is a great free tool that can be used for reverse engineering.  The only downside is that many of the default user interface options are less than optimal.  Luckily, Ghidra allows you to share configurations via Code Browser Tool files.  The tool file here is an export of our working code browser tool with all of the user interface settings updated to make analysis more pleasent.

For details about exactly what settings where changed and how to import the configurations into your own Ghidra program, view the blog post at https://agdcservices.com/blog/helpful-configurations-for-ghidra/
